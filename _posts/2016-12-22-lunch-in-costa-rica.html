<p>The increased availability of digital records on where organisms hangout (or <em>occur</em>) has been facilitated by
    <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/activities/darwincore/" target="_blank">Darwin Core</a>, a community standard for
    exchanging biodiversity information. TDWG (pronounced tahd-wick), the association that helped nurture this standards
    into maturity, held <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/conference2016/" target="_blank">this year's annual meeting</a> in
    Costa Rica. While the primary focus of Darwin Core is on species occurrence, <a href="http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extensions.do" target="_blank">an extension mechanism is provided</a> to
    help capture other kinds of aspects of biodiversity data. While some methods exist to help describe
    species interactions in DwC (e.g. <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedTaxa" target="_blank">associatedTaxa</a>,
    <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedOccurrences" target="_blank">associatedOccurrences</a>), various projects use "unofficial" extensions to
    express granular species interaction data. GloBI makes an effort to support all of the methods in the hope that, over time,
    we'll continue discuss and collaborate on ways to improve ways to share interaction data.</p>

<p>A long time GloBI contributor, Katja Schulz, presented a poster on a pragmatic approach to integrating species
    interaction data at the conference. Rather than relying on a single data exchange format, GloBI will take any
    existing (semi-)structured digital format to make existing datasets easier to access. With this approach, the burden
    of standardization of existing datasets is reduced. In addition, a continuous integration approach is taken: the
    datasets are continuously refreshed and linked against taxonomies, ontologies and other biodiversity data
    services. </p>

<p>Also, she, and some of her colleagues, joined for an in-promptu lunch to talk about species interaction data. I hope
    that the outcome of this lunch will contribute to the ongoing development of ways to easily exchange evidence records on
    how organisms rely on each other.</p>

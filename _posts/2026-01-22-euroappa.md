excerpt: "Demonstration on how to build an European Atlas Plant-Pollinator Associations by combining version of the GloBI corpus of Review Datasets with Eurostat/GISCO Geographical country data in a GeoPackage file.

Many openly accessible datasets exist that describe how plant interact with their pollinators (e.g., bees, bats, birds). And, an EU Horizon project "Butterfly" [```[1]```](#references) aims to use existing data, complemented by field observations, to establish EuroAPPA, an European Atlas of Plant Pollinator Associations.

There's many ways to build such an atlas and the text below describes one of them. The method below demonstrates how to combine an existing GloBI Corpus of Review Data and Eurostat/GISCO Geographical country data with DuckDB [```[2]```](#references), a small but mighty database, and QGIS, an open source geographic information system tool to create maps to show the geographic distribution of existing flower visitation and pollination record claims.

## Getting the Data

A Dec 2025 compilation of GloBI reviewed datasets is available through:

> Poelen, J. H. (ed.), & Global Biotic Interactions Community. (2025). Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) Review Dataset Corpus hash://md5/c326e584fb61f95d0075710c63dc2a33 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18064921 

This compilation dataset includes a derived file that includes reviewed interaction records in a gzipped tab-separated format [```interactions.tsv.gz```](https://zenodo.org/records/18064921/files/interactions.tsv.gz) with digital fingerprint ```hash://md5/7c12420410e0fea43608308c387fa89c``` .

Also, a [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) ```CNTR_RG_20M_2024_4326.gpkg``` with digital fingerprint ```hash://md5/8f345c975eb2ba6b1c92ea1ae27ec4cf``` was retrieved from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/administrative-units/countries on 2026-01-21 to help delineate current administrative boundaries of countries of interest.

## Building A GeoPackage Using DuckDB

Using the GloBI data review corpus and downloaded Eurostat/GISCO geographical data, a [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) ```euroappa.gpkg``` was created by selecting only georeferenced flower visitation and pollination claims within EU countries in addition to the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine. 

More specifically, the GeoPackage ```euroappa.gpkg``` was generated by running using DuckDB v1.2.1 8e52ec4395 as follows: 


```
cat generate-euroappa.sql | duckdb 
```

with ```generate-euroappa.sql``` containing:

```
INSTALL spatial;
LOAD spatial;
  
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS interactions 
AS SELECT 
  ST_POINT(decimalLongitude,decimalLatitude) as location, 
  decimalLatitude,
  decimalLongitude,
  sourceTaxonName, 
  interactionTypeName,
  targetTaxonName, 
  "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventDate" as eventDate,
  referenceCitation, 
  citation, 
  namespace, 
  lastSeenAt
FROM 
  'interactions.tsv.gz'
WHERE 
  interactionTypeName IN ('flowersVisitedBy','visitsFlowersOf', 'pollinates', 'pollinatedBy')
AND
  ST_IsValid(location);


CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS my_idx ON interactions USING RTREE (location);

COPY (
 SELECT interactions.*, countries.ISO3_CODE 
 FROM interactions
  JOIN (select geom as country, ISO3_CODE from 'CNTR_RG_20M_2024_4326.gpkg' WHERE EU_STAT = 'T' OR ISO3_CODE IN ['GBR', 'NOR', 'CHE', 'UKR']) as countries
  ON ST_Within(interactions.location, countries.country)
) 
TO 'euroappa.gpkg'
WITH (FORMAT gdal, DRIVER 'GPKG', SRS 'EPSG:4326');
```

## Data Clustering using DuckDB and H3

<div id="figure2" class="figure figure-globi left">
  <a href="/assets/euroappa-zoom-in-ireland-uk-2026-01-22-smaller.png"><img src="/assets/euroappa-zoom-in-ireland-uk-2026-01-22-smaller.png" alt=""/></a>
    <div class="figcaption"><em>Figure 2.</em> Density of flower visitation and pollination records found in a version of the GloBI Corpus of Reviewed Interaction Datasets <a href="#references">[4]</a>. Darker colors indicates higher density of data, whereas lighter colors indicate lower data density. Green/yellow hexagonals are of h3 resolution level 4, and blue hexagonals are h3 resolution level 6. Creating using OpenStreetMap, Eurostat/GISCO Geographical Data, DuckDB, and QGIS .</div>
</div>

The resulting geopackage was clustered using h3 [```[3]```](#references) on resolution level 4 (less granular) and 6 (more granular) to highlight the geographic distribution of flower visitation and pollination claims. These clustered data were packaged in data files ```euroappa-h3-level-4.gpkg``` and ```euroappa-h3-level-6.gpkg``` respectively and generated by:

```
cat generate-euroappa-h3-level-6.sql | duckdb 
```

with ```generate-euroappa-h3-level-6.sql``` containing:

```
INSTALL spatial;
LOAD spatial;
INSTALL h3 FROM community;
LOAD h3;

COPY (
  SELECT ST_GeomFromText(h3_cell_to_boundary_wkt(h3_cell)) as cell_boundary, number_of_records 
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      h3_latlng_to_cell(ST_Y(geom), ST_X(geom), 6) as h3_cell,
      LOG(1+COUNT(*)) as number_of_records
    FROM 
      'euroappa.gpkg'
    GROUP BY 
      h3_cell
) 
)
TO 'euroappa-h3-level-6.gpkg'
WITH (FORMAT gdal, DRIVER 'GPKG', SRS 'EPSG:4326');

```

## Creating Maps Using QGIS

<div id="figure3" class="figure figure-globi right">
  <a href="/assets/euroappa-zoom-in-germany-2026-01-22-smaller.png"><img src="/assets/euroappa-zoom-in-germany-2026-01-22-smaller.png" alt=""/></a>
    <div class="figcaption"><em>Figure 3.</em> Density of flower visitation and pollination records found in a version of the GloBI Corpus of Reviewed Interaction Datasets <a href="#references">[4]</a>. Darker colors indicates higher density of data, whereas lighter colors indicate lower data density. Green/yellow hexagonals are of h3 resolution level 4, and blue hexagonals are h3 resolution level 6. Creating using OpenStreetMap, Eurostat/GISCO Geographical Data, DuckDB, and QGIS .</div>
</div>

After creating the geopackages, [QGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS) v3.34.4-Prizren was used to visualize the h3 geopackages and put them on a map of the world provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). Figures [1.](#figure1), [2.](#figure2), and [3.](#figure3) highlight geographic areas with higher (darker), lower (lighter), or no data coverage. The larger yellow/green hexagons are at h3 resolution level 4, whereas the smaller blue hexagons are a more granular scale, at h3 resolution level 6.

## Discussion
Our examples shows that geographic maps indicating data availability of flower visitating and pollinator records can be generating using openly available datasets (e.g., GloBI data review corpus, Eurostat/GISCO geographical data) and open source data processing and visualization tools (e.g., DuckDB, QGIS).

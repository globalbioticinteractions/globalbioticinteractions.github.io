You can contribute to Global Biotic Interactions in many different ways: [use it](#use-it), [join a discussion](#join-a-discussion), [share data](#share-data), [contribute code](#contribute-code) or [donate](#donate).

## Use it
By using [GloBI](./data), you support it's mission: to help make species interaction datasets more accessible. 

## Join a Discussion
Ask questions, share ideas and stay informed by reviewing, commenting on, or opening, a [github issue](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/new). 

## Share Data
Various methods exist to share existing interaction data through Global Biotic Interactions:

1. Take a picture, upload it to [iNaturalist.org](https://www.inaturalist.org) and identify the interacting species using observation fields. For example see [Scott Loarie. 2013. _Haemorhous mexicanus_ eating _Heteromeles arbutifolia_. iNaturalist.org. Accessed at https://inaturalist.org/observations/432688 on 28 Aug 2014](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/432688). With a few exceptions, most research-grade iNaturalist interaction data is automatically included in GloBI. For a full list of iNaturalist observation fields GloBI imports, see the [iNaturalist to GloBI interaction map](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/inaturalist/blob/main/interaction_types.csv) . For specific instructions, please see [Ken's how-to-add-an-inaturalist-interaction document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jFMA5a6EH1tqW2DcuNV8AQj2tuzx7ZvQoXtxaObaJ0/edit)
1. Have a look at the [Dataset Management page](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/wiki/Dataset-Management), create a discoverable GitHub repository (or use our [template dataset repository](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset/generate) to get started). Your GloBI-compatible data repository will now be automatically included in GloBI and should appear on the [status page](http://globalbioticinteractions.org/status) within a couple of days. Use [GitHub<>Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) integration to make your data citable (see next step for more info). GloBI supports many existing interaction data formats, including but not limited to IPT RSS feeds (e.g., [Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN)](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/scan)) and DarwinCore Archives (e.g., [Illinois Natural History Survey Insect Collection](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/inhs-insects)). See all registered [datasets](/datasets) and the blog post ["Models in Fashion"](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2018/08/16/models-in-fashion/) for more examples. 
1. Publish your dataset on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and add your publication to [Zenodo's Global Biotic Interaction community](https://zenodo.org/communities/globalbioticinteractions). For more information, see [an example data publication](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/26293374).
1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/new) and provide a (permanent) url to a web-accessible existing interaction dataset along with a data citation. Any structured data format / API will do, and csv/tsv file formats are preferred. Examples include references to openly accessible datapaper (e.g. [Raymond et al. 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1907.1), [Ferrer-Paris et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1168861)), data hosted in Github (e.g. [Hurlbert 2014](https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase/)) or publicly accessible APIs (e.g. iNaturalist).  For citations, DOIs are preferred, but any will do as long as they describe the source of the data. If you don't have one already, services like [figshare](http://figshare.com), [dryad](http://datadryad.org/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) allow you to get one.
1. In case you are publishing a (data) paper that contains species interaction data, cite [Poelen et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005). The GloBI citation helps us to easily find your paper and make the published data easy to access.
1. In case the data is not (yet) web accessible, please [open an issue](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/new) in which you describe the dataset, and we can have a discussion on how to make the data available through GloBI.
1. Tweet/ tag a reference to an openly available food web dataset (or any other species interaction datasets) with [@GlobalBiotic](https://twitter.com/GlobalBiotic) to let GloBI take a stab at making them easier to find via https://globalbioticinteractions.org .

As the automated updates occur on a daily basis, it may take a day or two for updates or corrections to be available through GloBI and related libraries like [rglobi](http://github.com/ropensci/rglobi). For more information, see [GloBI's Data Integration Process page](/process) or [Poelen et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005).

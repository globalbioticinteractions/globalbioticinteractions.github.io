NASBR symposium abstracts
* Deadline now to Jul 10th
* We currently have 8 symposium abstracts
* Impact of taxonomic splits on bat-viral data
* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFPWLNxf5KrczCNGQzybiru93AwRtbx7l6NNWVgRcbY/edit – Current doc


* BatLit abstract
   * Could be edited more
   * Have the website: https://batlit.org/
      * Now 5.5k of the 20k+ PDFs from Van Cakenburge
      * All now uploaded via the cloud
      * AfricaBat Report, e.g., 2016: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311888337_African_Chiroptera_Report_2016
         * Lots of data here, difficult to access
         * I think this is the latest one: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364943183_African_Chiroptera_Report_2022_Complete_Report
         * Perhaps there is a structured database that underlies this?


Jorrit is additionally processing the BHL bat publications
* 25k articles that cover bats, but also some other taxa (Jorrit: 2024-07-05 an initial assessment suggests about 6k works that mention "Chiroptera". https://github.com/bat-literature/bat-literature.github.io/issues/15 . Please cite sources for the 25k articles to that I can understand the discrepancies)
* Part of the Plazi workflow – but Jorrit is helping to optimize in some ways
* Data in supplements in PubMedCentral – OCR and using the figures and tables
* Could import these via JATS etc
* OR import the articles as supplements – into Biodiversity PMC
   * Shortcut for getting data in – still searchable and parseable 
   * Jorrit helping with versioning of those data
   * Donat wanting to make the data accessible for search
* Cullen and Donat are sponsoring for now – until we get further funding (R01?)
* Targets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxi-ndcZJymKiAJx0XiIllx29UuIO5Ndzo0vo9uEZxg/edit?gid=0#gid=0
* 

Initial BatLit uploads
* https://github.com/bat-literature/bat-literature.github.io/issues/14
* In Zenodo Sandbox, with metadata – for checking now
* Could we also add the Supplementary Files?
   * E.g., scan documents for “supplement” and then have a part of the pipeline that brings in those files as well
   * Currently not being dealt with – but it is a big issue
* Could we pull out full text of all these articles in a batch way – if OCRed
* 

Cullen linked to – https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02472-w
* A dataset on African bats’ functional traits
* “Here, we present the AfroBaT dataset, a compilation of trait data on 320 African bat species containing 76,914 values for 86 traits focusing on morphology, reproduction, life-history, trophic ecology, and species distributions.”

Present: Hernani, Aja, Nancy, Nate, Ariadna, Anna, Cullen, Cecilia, Donat, Jorrit




Bat literature
* Data from Cakenburghe
   * 1400 articles just starting with E
* OSF library is having difficulty with the size of the data – 50 Gb, likely more than that, of PDFs
   * Jorrit has 10 TB for 20 euros a month https://www.hetzner.com/de/storage/storage-box/.
* Zotero shared library
   * Jorrit is indexing from here: https://bat-literature.github.io/#version-history
      * https://bat-literature.github.io v0.3 just released today.
      * refs.csv has limited metadata of ~1000 paper 
* Swiss-based bat literature repository
   * These were all file cabinets of non-digitized literature
   * Similar to what is at major museums
   * From Manuel Ruedi        
      * “Well, as I said, I don't have so many pdfs, mostly from the last 15 years (which you certainly already have). Before that, had my private collection of reprints, but not digitalized, and not so many (if you want them all, you can can get them; most will be destroyed anyway upon my retirement, in 3 years from now...). But the most complete library of paper reprints of bats of the World (former private colelction of Villy Aellen + many more since Pascal's rule), are in our Museum library; for this, contact our chief librarian Laura.Zbinden@ville-ge.ch. As our museum in now under repare for the next few months, she will also tell you if and when those bat reprints will be again available (currently, they are in boxes and inaccessible).Hope it helps. Manuel Ruedi”
      * “Dear Manuel– Do you happen to have Pascal Möschler’s email – or is he not anymore involved in bat and the global bat library? His email seems not to work anymore. pascal.moeschler@ville-ge.ch Thanks for a hint Donat”
        
   * Searching DOIs
   * Looking up open access or not: 
   * R Package Open Alex: https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/
   * Also the RCrossRef package
   * https://ciakovx.github.io/rcrossref.html
   * Jorrit already did this query in OpenAlex: https://github.com/bat-literature/bat-literature.github.io/issues/2
   * Not 100% reliable though
   * Donat helped follow this up:
   * https://github.com/bat-literature/bat-literature.github.io/issues/2#issuecomment-2153428532
   * Unpaywall is another option
   * https://unpaywall.org/products/simple-query-tool
   * Up to 1000 queries at a time
   * “Reference-extract sheet that is incomplete and using Zotero tools/platform to fill gaps. This open access column is not in the Zotero references.csv  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5uBKvyzDQgQUtyRHvn5f20IOA7LoMho/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111971835458035348757&rtpof=true&sd=true ”
   * Aim is to emulate this TaxoDros:
   * https://zenodo.org/communities/taxodros/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest
   * https://taxodros.github.io/ << view on how to query these things
   * Donat: “cakenberg has 34480 bibliographic references” !


Big Bat Database work
   * They have 100 databases that they are extracting from
   * Taking all the verbatim names and locations from the databases
   * Not as broad as PanTHERIA, etc
   * More primary syntheses of individual traits from the literature
   * @Hernani (he/him) @Ariadna Morales (she/her) @Cecilia Montauban et al. do you consider species interactions a trait? (e.g., parasite, fruit plant, prey etc.)
   * Yes, to some extent – not an entire focus, but does include this
   * Initially related to the genomes of the bats – for the Bat1K folks

NASBR Symposium abstracts
   * Cullen to submit collation in two weeks (July 3 – but abstracts to her by July 1)
   * Most pressing 


Jorrit is open to going to NASBR
   * But we could also re-invest those funds into more data extraction
   * Work has been to get all those publications up on Zenodo
   * Then following the Drosophila workflow
   * We could have a pre-meeting workday
   * Oct 24-26 are the main meeting days (https://www.nasbr.org/annual-meetings)
   * Oct 23 we could have a meeting everyone together
   * Ask the group about to what extent want to interact in person versus keep that into the repository
   * If he goes – maximize his impact – advertise the initiative        
   * Could make a poster for the purposes
   * Recruit PDFs from meeting attendees


Bat literature digitization work
   * Uploading to BiodiversityPMC
   * Not only taxonomic papers
   * Ecological papers
   * Shared archive of Bat Cons International
   * OSF folder where collecting PDFs: https://osf.io/28cvq/files/googledrive
   * Want to start uploading documents
   * Do we have a quality control pre-check? Could be above the technical capabilities of the folks with the PDF libraries
   * Journals: 
   * From web of science journal list: 
   * African Bat Conservation News https://www.africanbats-npc.org/abcn
   * AFRICAN CHIROPTERA REPORT https://www.africanbats-npc.org/acr

   * Map of Life folks are there
   * But not currently sending data back to GBIF
   * GBIF, CoL folks are at the meeting – Tim Robertson
   * Plazi aims to get new names into CoL
   * Question
   * How to resolve all the names
   * Need to cite taxonomic treatments

05 June 2024
Present: Nancy, DeeAnn, Kendra, Quentin, Aja, Ariadna Morales, Hernani Oliveira, Cecilia Montauban, Nate (late)
   * Introductions for guests
   * Discussing NASBR 2024 Symposium: 


Potential Presenters and Proposed Titles:


Presenter:  Nancy B. Simmons – American Museum of Natural History (USA)
Proposed Title:  Key links in the global bat data chain


Presenter: Hernani F. M. Oliveira - Universidade de Brasília (Brazil). 
Proposed title: Challenges and perspectives in collating bat trait data worldwide.


Presenter: Winifred Frick - Bat Conservation International (USA) 
Proposed Title:  Bat data for conservation planning: the What, How, and Why


Presenter: Nathan Upham - Arizona State University (USA)
Proposed Title:  When do taxonomic splits matter for bat biodiversity and viral risk analyses?


Presenter: Aja Sherman - Bat Eco-Interactions Project (USA)
Proposed title: The Bat Taxonomic Alignment (BTA), A Standardized Review of Bat Names Across Multiple Taxonomic Authorities 


Presenter: Cullen Geiselman - Bat Eco-Interactions Project (USA)
Proposed Title: Liberating literature and the data within: the Bat Literature Repository and evolution of data extraction and curation


   * Cullen suggested offline “Perhaps we should consider the main points we'd like participants that attend the whole thing will take away instead of talking about BTA, Co-roosting dataset, etc in separate talks.”
   * Aja suggested one talk on liberating inaccessible literature and dark data (as well as linking) and another on taxonomy for this process, the BTA, and struggles with keeping up with taxonomic changes.
   * Hernani will present on Big Bat Database, traits that colleagues are measuring, and how to link.
   * Nancy was concerned that Nate and Aja’s talks will be too similar. Let’s discuss this with Nate when he returns. Also concern that 3 taxonomy talks might be redundant. Agreed that Nancy’s talk will still be relevant since some friends don’t know about existing databases, darwin core, or other available resources. 
   * Kendra asked about the status of the Big Bat Database. Members gave us background and informed us that changes are happening with new management…
   * Nancy recommends Hernani presents on the Big Bat Database, the history, and current challenges
   * Aja introduced the co-roosting
   * Hernani will share literature associated with best practices for data mining
   * Hernani asked if we document unpublished anecdotal interactions, Nancy recommends to leave these out unless published evidence
   * Cecilia interested in how we keep track of where the interactions are documented from, Aja shared citation lists and internal identifiers
   * https://www.nature.com/articles/s44185-024-00043-9
   * https://libguides.derby.ac.uk/literature-reviews/prisma-lr
   * https://biotxplorer.text-analytics.ch/?species1=Rhinolophus&size=1
   * https://zenodo.org/communities/coviho/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest
   * DeeAnn emphasizing gray literature from conservation organizations
   * How to access this?
   * E.g., interactions noted from non-peer reviewed literature
   * Could flag this in the data matrix
   * https://smartconservationtools.org/en-us/
   * “SMART platform consists of a set of software and analysis tools designed to help conservationists manage and protect wildlife and wild places. SMART can help standardize and streamline data collection, analysis, and reporting, making it easier for key information to get from the field to decision-makers.”
   * Nate parsing his talk relative to Aja’s
   * Will be a use case of the BTA on bat-virus interaction data – so will follow logically after Aja’s BTA talk
   * Interfacing with Kendra too
   * Nancy and Aja mentioned the IUCN integration of the Batnames.org / MDD taxonomy for bats – feeding this into conservation action








10 May 2024
Present: Nate


Brainstorming for the GBatNet meeting – name of group and notes on the “short blurb” that we need prior to Weds to be included in the printed materials:
   * Name ideas
   * Bat Biotic Interactions for Organizing Mammal Ecology (BatBIOME)
   * Bio Biotic Interactions Organized by Species (BatBIOS)


   * Blurb [sent to Susan Tsang on 16 May]
   * Our mission is to digitally liberate and organize all knowledge of bat biotic interactions – including that contained in taxonomic and ecological literature, databases, biocollections, and other archives – for studying the multifaceted ecological roles of bats worldwide. We are a group of biodiversity collections-related scientists that have been meeting weekly since April 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic reminded us that much of the knowledge of bats interacting with other bats, as well as with parasites, predators, prey, and habitats, are locked in offline books or paywalled PDFs and thus constitute ‘dark data’ that are digitally unavailable for synthetic analyses. These data are central to building robust models of viral spillover risk and other complex ecological dynamics, the predictive abilities of which are increasingly critical to society. Additionally, the pace at which taxonomic changes to bats and other taxa are occurring has brought considerable instability to sources of genetic and ecological data that are linked by species names and inform these models. Therefore, our group endeavors to both improve the digital access and taxonomic linking of biotic interaction data for bat species globally.




8 May 2024
Present: Aja, Kendra, DeeAnn, Cullen, Quentin
Aja caught DeeAnn up on what happened last week
Kendra notes that she will be attending the iDigBio meeting - will give a presentation at the “Digital Collections Data and Tracking Disease Workshop” - really interested in bat synonymy and in co-species data [so, this is us]


Kendra asked for slides to help - Aja shared prior slides, Cullen also has some…


DeeAnn - we really need to settle on our working group name. 
   * Bat Biotic Interactions and Taxonomy[a] Working Group [or are we a network - GBatNet categorization] - Cullen will ask Tigga for advice on working group or network. Or consortium?
   * Bat Biotic Interactions and Taxonomic Alignment[b] Consortium?
   * Need greater group input; should have this settled by next week’s meeting
Aja/ChatGPT suggestions:
Global Bat Taxonomy and Ecology Network (GB-TEN)
Bat Taxonomic Interactions Initiative (BTII)
International Bat Biodiversity and Interaction Consortium (IB-BIC)
Bat Taxonomy and Ecological Network (BTEN)
Global Bat Diversity and Interaction Project (GBDIP)
Bat Taxonomy and Ecological Dynamics Consortium (B-TEDC)
International Bat Taxonomy and Ecological Nexus (IB-TEN)
Bat Taxonomy and Interaction Collaborative Hub (BATICH)
Worldwide Bat Taxonomy and Ecological Exchange (W-BTEE)
Bat Taxonomy and Interaction Assessment Network (BTIAN)
As a grou, we reviewed the current GBatNet networks and “Interdisciplinary Projects” [AKA working groups]. We are akin to the “Bat Phenotypes and Evolution Network (BPEN)”??
Aja news: BTA done (will step aside for a bit, then review); will work on making it a relational database as next steps. Co-roosting and BTA manuscripts are in the works. She is also creating how-to videos and tutorials for the BTA. 
Aja invited the team to review both datasets while she is writing, but plans to review one more time before publication. 
We are still tackling the landing site for the searchable platform for the literature collection and BTA (probably batbase).




Co-roosting data and BTA are done!
Zotero goals: 20K more by end of summer


Aja - to DeeAnn and Nancy - need more examples of lineages with lots of change/unusual scenarios (e.g., Pteronotus, Miniopterus)


Aja will work with Quentin on Gephi interaction models, species accumulation curve, and possible data mining automation resources.


Aja asked the group: When making co-roosing dataset - was there a plan for automating it? Cullen thought we would be able to use our data as a training set…


Cullen - provided some funds for Jorrit to work with Zotero collection - pdfs to zenodo etc….


Discussed NASBR symposium proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFPWLNxf5KrczCNGQzybiru93AwRtbx7l6NNWVgRcbY/edit 


Will submit the 14th


Quentin new business: recently had a meeting with a group that wants to push forward a IUCN working group on parasites. Interesting to think about what IUCN status might look like for parasites. Endo and ectoparasites etc… will keep our group apprised as to how it progresses.

   * https://www.bioliteenergy.com/products/campstove-2-plus 


Top priorities right now
   * Taxonomy for the co-roosting dataset
   * Did a check against the GBIF backbone – using this to verify
   * Bat-bat interactions
   * We can dig into this part of the dataset to a greater extent
   * Plot the two phylogenies facing each other
   * Make line thickness proportional to the frequency of interactions
   * Rarefaction analysis as well
   * Are these sampling curves saturating?  Or will it go on and on depending on increased sampling
   * BTA manuscript
   * How-to for the BTA






14 Feb 2024
Present: DeeAnn, Nancy, Aja, Nate


AirTags – helpful for tagging the field supplies when traveling


Ebola virus-like particles – just have the protein on the outside to be recognized by the bats – 


Using DNA/RNA shield – also BAMM Banker for tissue culture
   * Slowly make way into freezing
   * Needs new -80C


Aja update
   * BTA versions – batNames – 




7 Feb 2024
Present: Cullen, Kendra, Nate, Nancy, Anna, Donat, Quentin


Anna presenting on ringtail omnivory at the University of Georgia, Odum School of Ecology annual student symposium
   * Rank abundance curves of dietary items in scat
   * Being an omnivore is on a big spectrum
   * https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=41676
   * Includes lots of feces images
   * Early ASM poster about this work (Speir et al. 2022)


Cullen / Donat / Aja / Nancy
   * Digitization of bat literature – all literature is the plan there – 
   * First working on 20k Drosophila publications
   * Will figure out full workflow there
   * Bat literature library in Switzerland – in Geneva – Can order PDFs from them
   * Muséum in Geneva https://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/bd/mhng/cco/accueil.php , and was founded by the now retired Pascal Moeschler.
   * Lots of low hanging fruit here
   * Victor Van Calkenburgh has a massive PDF library that he gave access to
   * What are the goals?
   * Every publication ever on a bat?
   * Can be a parallel bibliographic effort and PDF ect
   * Multiple goals
   * 1. Get full bibliography reference for all publications
   * 2. Get PDFs for those papers
   * 3. Upload PDFs to Zenodo
   * 4. Tag / annotate / extract PDFs for forming digital knowledge
   * For 2-3-4 steps, can target a specific topic / clade
   * What metadata do we need? 
   * Some columns already developed on the “reference-extract” sheet of the co-roosting data. 


   * Nate / MDD can send literature on bats from the Zotero of the MDD
   * Will send to Aja


Bat Libraries:
 
   * Bat bibliographies generated from the General Index subset: 
   * Special Index to Species: https://archive.org/details/IndexGenerium 
Other Internet Archive scans: 
   * BioStor https://archive.org/details/biostor-127588/page/438/mode/2up 
   * Big issue with bioheritage library is the lack of separated articles. Volumes are scanned and not parsed by article metadata. 
   * Lack of funding/staff to do this. Priority is Smithosonians own stuff




24 Jan 2024
Present: Donat, Cullen, Kendra, Nate, Nancy, Aja, Quentin


Our collective bodily injuries and aging
   * Nancy retiring – getting rid of administrative things


Liberating large amounts of bat literature
   * Could we take all the PDFs from Nancy’s computer – plus the files from batBase
   * Possible to have a drag and drop?
   * Nancy has a combined folder for the first time – just joined things across computers
   * Aja can help to create the Zotero record – BibTex or other –
   * Then Donat can work with Plazi team to automate the uploads to Zenodo
   * Also add the MDD references in this context
   * 196 “bat” references included – not updated for the v1.12 version


Philippines project work – aiming to get more funding via EcoHealth
   * https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/07/deep-vzn-virus-wild-usaid-program/
   * https://stopspillover.org/ (program that is funded by USAID)
   * Lots of in country work being done – 
   * Capacity building ultimately

Present: Quentin, Cullen, Kendra, Aja, Nate, Donat


Updating the taxonomy of the bat co-roosting data
   * Quentin took all the names included + matched it against the GBIF taxonomy backbone
   * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5uBKvyzDQgQUtyRHvn5f20IOA7LoMho/edit#gid=691336520
   * WorkingDoc_Raw-Data-Extraction_ExpertLiterature_8_8
   * Steps were to use the GBIF taxonomy matcher tool
   * Species lookup: https://www.gbif.org/tools/species-lookup
   * ChecklistBank has something different – provides stable identifiers – 
   * https://www.checklistbank.org/tools/name-match
   * Will return “valid” species names – but the species could still definitely be split
   * Kendra example with Miniopterus schreibersii – used to be widespread species, now restricted to Europe – so all the records in the Philippines are inaccurate
   * Sources for digitizing all the bat literature
   * Try different sources
   * Private funding
   * Swiss Govt – RDF version of checklist bank – $300k for these conversion services – just for the Swiss bats for the starter
   * Proof of what can be done for the swiss species
   * BiCikL – Arcadia
   * Working with Nancy – to get all the bat literature – leverage to get more funds to expand further
   * Gathering PDFs from her, batnames, MDD
   * Some of the bibliographic data contain errors currently


   * Knowledge Hub with the BiCiKL
   * https://bicikl-project.eu/biodiversity-knowledge-hub
   * Pensoft is involved because of the JATS conversion needed for PMC – Biodiversity PMC
   * https://sibils.text-analytics.ch/search/ (SibIs portal)
   * Also this “Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity”: https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/biodiversity_en


   * Locality information for the bat co-roosting information
   * There is a need to consider the “localityCountry” field in comparing to the BTA for taxonomic translation
   * Compare this to the “countryDistribution” field in the MDD for example – create a pairwise country matrix for doing this
   * >> Then have logic for the subsequent comparisons
   * E.g., if nameA exists in countryX in taxonomyY, then we have the possibility of properly translating taxonomic splits

Present: Kendra, Nancy, Quintin, Anna 


   * Hellos from the holidays 
   * Quintin working on
   * flora online : no global one available that’s great; need for more specific areas (e.g., Congo) 
   * Difficult to acquire funding for the projects
   * IUCN invasive species as threat 
   * Data available through rredlist R package 
   * Role of reference books 
   * ICTV virus taxonomy still heavily referenced book 
   * Walker’s large bat book: almost 25 lbs
   * Walker’s Mammals of the World may have had last version in 2018
   * Interesting/Harsh Review broaching the topic https://www.mammalwatching.com/2018/07/17/a-review-a-long-review-of-the-latest-version-of-walkers-mammals-of-the-world/ 
   * Out of date by the time their published?  
   * IUCN
   * embedded citations + species-specific authors can give idea of when updated 
   * 2000 was when all animals started to be assessed
   * Many bats that were listed covered since the ‘80s
   * Taxonomy always an issue in any of the records 
   * How to deal with rejection/controversy 


[a]Doesn't really capture what we do - not to be confused with Bat Taxonomy Working Group... Need Nancy's advice
[b]Harmony?

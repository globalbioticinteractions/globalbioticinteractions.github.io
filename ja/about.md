    <h3 id="what">What is GloBI?</h3>

    <p>Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides <a href="http://opendefinition.org/ossd/" title="open service definition">open access</a> to finding species interaction data (e.g., predator-prey, pollinator-plant, pathogen-host, parasite-host) by combining existing <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/" title="open data definition">open datasets</a> using <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" title="open source definition">open source</a> software.

    <h3 id="why">Why GloBI?</h3>

    <p><i>
      “The various books and journals of ornithology and entomology are like a row of beehives containing an immense amount of valuable honey, which has been stored up in separate cells by the bees that made it. The advantage, and at the same time the difficulty, of ecological work is that it attempts to provide conceptions which can link up into some complete scheme the colossal store of facts about natural history which has accumulated up to date in this rather haphazard manner. This applies with particular force to facts about the food habits of animals. Until more organised information about the subject is available, it is only possible to give a few instances of some of the more clear­cut niches which happen to have been worked out.”</i> - <a href="https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7236467">Charles Elton, 1927. <em>Animal Ecology</em>. pp 65-66. </a></p>
    <p><i>“Biodiversity researchers have focused on diversity at the cost of ignoring the networks of interactions between organisms that characterize ecosystems.”</i> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/446029a">Kevin McCann,
        2007</a></p>

    <p><i>“An essential element of a truly inclusionary and democratic approach to science is to share data through
        publicly accessible data sets.”</i> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biu169">Soranno et al., 2014</a>
    </p>

    <p>Now that folks have mapped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">human genome</a>, put
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong">a man on the moon</a>, isn't it time to provide easy
        access to how, when and where organisms interact with each other so that we can better understand and better
        preserve our ecosystems? Perhaps GloBI can become the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
        of ecology: a global map that shows how organisms rely on each other . . . </p>

    <p>By providing an infrastructure to capture and share interaction data, individual biologists can focus on
        gathering new interaction data and analyzing existing datasets without having to spend resources on (re-)
        building a cyberinfrastructure to do so.

    <h3 id="who">Who makes GloBI possible?</h3>

    <p>GloBI is made possible by a community of software engineers, bioinformaticists and biologists. Software engineers
        such as <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/jhpoelen">Jorrit Poelen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coding46">Göran
            Bodenschatz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/reiz">Robert Reiz</a> collaborate with bioinformaticists
        like <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/chris-mungall/">Chris Mungall</a>, data managers like <a href="http://github.com/millerse">Sarah E. Miller</a> and biologists like <a
                href="http://ccs.tamucc.edu/people/dr-james-d-simons/">Jim Simons</a>, <a
                href="http://ronininstitute.org/research-scholars/anne-thessen/">Anne Thessen</a>, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9943-2342">Jen Hammock</a> and <a
                href="https://sites.google.com/site/haydenresearch/">Brian Hayden</a> to capture, provide access to and use interaction data
        that is provided by <a href="/references.html">biologists and citizen scientists around the world</a>. <b>GloBI is sustained by an intricate network of  thriving open source, open data and open science communities</b> in addition to receiving donations, grants, awards or being written into grants, including, but not limited to, EOL's <a href="http://eol.org/info/485">EOL Rubenstein Fellows Program</a> (CRDF EOL-33066-13/F33066, 2013) and the David M. Rubenstein Grant (FOCX-14-60988-1, 2014), and the Smithsonian Institution (SI) (T15CC10297-002, 2016). If you would like to contribute to GloBI please visit our <a href="contribute" target="_blank">contribute</a> page. </p>

    <h3 id="share">How to share data through GloBI?</h3>

    <p>GloBI exists because of people like yourself who share their interaction data, or refer to existing datasets that
        are not yet <a href="references">included in GloBI</a>. Do you have some interaction data you'd like to access through GloBI? Please read <a href="contribute">this</a>.

    <h3 id="education">How to use GloBI as an educational tool?</h3>

    <p>Education experts such as Marie Studer and Jeff Holmes at <a href="http://education.eol.org">EOL Learning + Education</a> have developed <a href="http://education.eol.org/eco/#">tools</a> and <a href="http://eol.org/info/ed_resources#ecology">lession plans</a> to better understand food webs in specific and ecosystems in general. Also, Daniela Baron <em>et al.</em> created an <a href="http://danielabar.github.io/globi-proto/">Interactive Ecosystem Explorer</a> for high school students. In addition, many other educational resources exist including, but not limited to, <a href="http://hhmi.org">hhmi</a>'s <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/exploring-trophic-cascades">Trophic Cascades</a> and <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/earthviewer">Earth Viewer</a>. Ideally, GloBI will help facilitate to create, and improve, these openly accessible educational resources.</p>

ProPollSoil is funded as part of [Mission Soil, the "soil deal for Europe"](https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu/project-hub/funded-projects-under-mission-soil) through the call for proposal ["Soil health, pollinators and key ecosystem functions" HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-05](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-05) .

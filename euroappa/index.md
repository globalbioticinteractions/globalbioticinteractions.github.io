EuroAPPA aims to be a

> [...] One-stop shop for animal pollinator ecology: BUTTERFLY’s European Atlas of Plant-Pollinator Associations (EuroAPPA) will provide user-friendly access for all stakeholders to the most complete taxonomically-harmonised well-curated database of plant-pollinator interactions ever produced for Europe and three Overseas Territories/Outermost Regions. [...]

and is a key result defined in the BUTTERFLY proposal. 

The BUTTERFLY project is about "Mainstreaming pollinator stewardship in view of cascading ecological, societal and economic impacts of pollinator decline" and relates to the EU Horizon call: [HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-3](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl6-2024-biodiv-01-2) — `Biodiversity and ecosystem services (HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01) / Dependence of society and the economy on pollinators`.

This page contains references to EuroAPPA and related projects with a specific focus on species interactions (e.g., plant-pollinator) datasets.

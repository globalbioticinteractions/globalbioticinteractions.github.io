# **Use Cases For EuroAPPA**

(October 2025)

Reminder: In EuroAPPA, we will focus on reusing two existing systems: DoPI and tools within GloBI, plus adding results from modelling and mapping exercises in WP1 (i.e. we don’t aim to build new infrastructures, except what we need for the modelling results).

A **use case** is a short story about specific actors performing specific tasks with (in this case) EuroAPPA. We are compiling example Use Cases to request new ones from other stakeholders. This will help us address all potential user needs when designing EuroAPPA's interface.

## Use Case 1 - A Honours/Master's student who wants data for their thesis (Jeff)

**Goal:** Address the following two questions: (1) How complete is the pollen host-plant coverage of bee species that are included in the most recent IUCN Red List: <https://iucn.org/press-release/202510/mounting-risks-threaten-survival-wild-european-pollinators-iucn-red-list> ? (2) Are certain pollen host types over- or under-represented in the list? __Prediction__: More specialised bees (i.e. monolectic species) will be over-represented.

**Actors:** The Honour/Master's student and their thesis advisor(s); (if applicable) editor of the journal; (if applicable) peer reviewers

**Resources:** Internet; EuroAPPA; IUCN Red List; literature on bee plant hosts; R for data analysis; word processing software for the thesis write-up

Steps: (1) Download IUCN data on bees; (2) Download data from EuroAPPA on bees and their host plants; (3) Assess coverage of the downloaded data in relation to the IUCN data; (4) Assess the -lecty (i.e., pollen specificity - mono-/poly-lectic) of the bees in the IUCN List versus the -lecty for European bee species generally; (5) Statistical analysis; (6) Discussion of results with thesis advisor(s); (7) Write up of the thesis; (8) Write up of a research paper if appropriate.

Out of scope (for this use case) - communication with EuroAPPA folks and partner; detailing

Question -

- Which use case describes the EuroAPPA team's collaborations with their users?
- Which use case describes the EuroAPPA team's internal communication and collaboration?
- What kind of alternate use cases using different resources and taxa (e.g., caterpillars) could be imagined?

## Use Case 2 - IPBES Global Assessment

Goal

- **Question:** What European evidence exists on the decline of pollination interactions for the next global assessment?
- **EuroAPPA use:** Export machine-readable datasets and summaries linking temporal interaction data with land-use change and climate models.

## Use Case 3 - European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) researching the pollinators of Green Beans (a food crop) (Cala)

**Goal:** An EFSA researcher is investigating the dependence of food crops (e.g., green beans) on pollinators. They address the following questions: (1) What is the current scientific knowledge of the floral visitors of the crop plant (Green beans)? (2) Is there variation in the visitors of the Green Beans crop across different geographical areas of Europe? 3) Are there knowledge gaps in the visitors of plant species x in some areas where it is cultivated? 4) is there evidence of changes in the pollinators of crop x over time?

**Actors:** EFSA researchers

**Resources:** EuroAPPA; [CropPol database](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3614); primary literature on crop pollination

**Steps**: (1) Check CropPol; (2) Download EuroAPPA data on target species; (3) compare coverage (4) map records 5) run statistical analysis for temporal differences in pollinators

**Note** - GloBI reviewed a version of CropPol (see Elton, Nomer, & Preston. (2025). A Review of Biotic Interactions and Taxon Names Found in ibartomeus/OBservData hash://md5/35b1210f8b22088babe73b2b9012c15e. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15256406> )

## Use Case 6 - Citizen or Gardener (Claus)

- **Question:** What native plants should I grow to help local pollinators?
- **EuroAPPA use:** Search for local pollinator–plant interactions and distribution maps filtered by region, returning lists of species observed in a specific Location and their host plants.

**Goal**

Homeowners or renters (not specifically gardeners) want to know which bee plants are best for their gardens in Aarhus, Denmark.

**Actors**

1. Someone living in Aarhus, Denmark, with an interest in bee health.
2. expert organisations (e.g., wild garden NGOs or individuals, Claus R.)
3. plant sellers - nurseries

**Resources**

the internet; a garden in Aarhus; webpage on the publication of a physical, nice-looking poster on bees by Claus.

**Steps**

1. homeowner goes out and looks at the garden in Aarhus 
2. homeowner notices there's a lot of grass and concrete in their yard
3.  homeowner identifies where to change the grass/concrete to get something else 
4. homeowner searches the internet for "bee-friendly garden" (in Danish, "bi-venlig have") 
5. home owner finds Claus' name related to the published poster on bees. 
6. homeowner asks Claus to list plants that are bee-friendly. 
7. 
   1. 7.a) Claus suggests going to the nursery and observing which plants are visited by bees at the nursery (go and have a look). 
   2. 7.b) for skilled gardeners, Claus provides a detailed list of plants instead 8) homeowner go to the nursery and buy the plants.

**Question** 

What to do if the flowers aren't flowering? How to buy plants out of season (e.g., maybe look at the label).

Wouldn't it be a nice idea to have Claus publish his plant list through EuroAPPA? How do we make EuroAPPA so that homeowners can easily query for bee-friendly plants in Aarhus, Denmark?

How does EuroAPPA facilitate the provision of the plant list to the homeowner?

How does Claus make his knowledge available within constraints (money, time), while also being attributed for this work?

How do existing resources (e.g., the EU Butterfly Hub) facilitate the provision of the plant list to the homeowner?

## Use Case 7 - Energy & Agriculture Policy Researcher (Butterfly WP4) (Jeroen/ Dehui)

- **Question:** Which pollinators service rapeseed crops in Poland vs Germany vs France, and what are the vulnerabilities for bioenergy supply chains?
- **EuroAPPA use:** Compare regional interaction datasets to identify key pollinators for Brassica napus and link them to land-use and pesticide datasets for risk assessment.

**Goal**

# **Invitation to provide a use case for EuroAPPA**

## draft email to invite a variety of stakeholders

Dear (personalise), 

EuroAPPA will be a platform providing access to EU-wide pollination information and resources, developed as part of the project Butterfly. EuroAPPA is not a database per se, but will instead provide access and reviews of multiple resources, including databases, from a single location. 

We expect the capabilities of EuroAPPA to be:     #(add more details here)

- search pairwise interactions of plants and pollinators, including location and time (as in [GloBI](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org))
- search for evidence of effective pollination by different pollinators to wild and crop plants
- produce interactive maps of pollination interactions in Europe
- generate data reviews across databases with pollination information

(Alex: insert text indicating the time needed to prepare a use case)

**We are asking for your input in the form of example(s) on how you would use EuroAPPA in your work.** These use cases from diverse stakeholders will help us develop the best way to provide access to resources in EuroAPPA. Use cases can come from any potential user, from the general public to expert pollination scientists. Please use this simple format to provide your use case(s):

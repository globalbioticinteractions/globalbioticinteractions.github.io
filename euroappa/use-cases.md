# **Use Cases For EuroAPPA**

(to see an outline of this document on the left of the screen, press Headings above and chose “Show outline”) 

###### Reminder: In EuroAPPA, we will focus on updating and reusing two existing systems:  tools within GloBI, and DoPI, plus adding results from modelling and mapping exercises in WP1 (i.e. we don’t aim to build new infrastructures, except what we need for the modelling results).

**Definition of use case**  
A **use case** is a short story about specific actors performing specific tasks with (in this case) EuroAPPA. We are compiling example Use Cases to request new ones from other stakeholders. This will help us address all potential user needs when designing EuroAPPA's interface.

## Use Case 1 - A Honours/Master's student who wants data for their thesis (Jeff)

**Goal:** Address the following two questions: (1) How complete is the pollen host-plant coverage of bee species that are included in the most recent IUCN Red List: <https://iucn.org/press-release/202510/mounting-risks-threaten-survival-wild-european-pollinators-iucn-red-list> ? (2) Are certain pollen host types over- or under-represented in the list? __Prediction__: More specialised bees (i.e. monolectic species) will be over-represented.

**Actors:** The Honour/Master's student and their thesis advisor(s); (if applicable) editor of the journal; (if applicable) peer reviewers

**Resources:** Internet; EuroAPPA; IUCN Red List; literature on bee plant hosts; R for data analysis; word processing software for the thesis write-up

Steps: (1) Download IUCN data on bees; (2) Download data from EuroAPPA on bees and their host plants; (3) Assess coverage of the downloaded data in relation to the IUCN data; (4) Assess the -lecty (i.e., pollen specificity - mono-/poly-lectic) of the bees in the IUCN List versus the -lecty for European bee species generally; (5) Statistical analysis; (6) Discussion of results with thesis advisor(s); (7) Write up of the thesis; (8) Write up of a research paper if appropriate.

Out of scope (for this use case) - communication with EuroAPPA folks and partner; detailing

Question -

- Which use case describes the EuroAPPA team's collaborations with their users?
- Which use case describes the EuroAPPA team's internal communication and collaboration?

**Goal**

Homeowners or renters (not specifically gardeners) want to know which bee plants are best for their gardens in Aarhus, Denmark.

**Actors**

1. Someone living in Aarhus, Denmark, with an interest in bee health.
2. expert organisations (e.g., wild garden NGOs or individuals, Claus R.)
3. plant sellers - nurseries

**Resources**

the internet; a garden in Aarhus; webpage on the publication of a physical, nice-looking poster on bees by Claus.

**Steps**

1. homeowner goes out and looks at the garden in Aarhus 
2. homeowner notices there's a lot of grass and concrete in their yard
3.  homeowner identifies where to change the grass/concrete to get something else 
4. homeowner searches the internet for "bee-friendly garden" (in Danish, "bi-venlig have") 
5. home owner finds Claus' name related to the published poster on bees. 
6. homeowner asks Claus to list plants that are bee-friendly. 
7. 
   1. 7.a) Claus suggests going to the nursery and observing which plants are visited by bees at the nursery (go and have a look).

**Question** 

What to do if the flowers aren't flowering? How to buy plants out of season (e.g., maybe look at the label).

Wouldn't it be a nice idea to have Claus publish his plant list through EuroAPPA? How do we make EuroAPPA so that homeowners can easily query for bee-friendly plants in Aarhus, Denmark?

How does EuroAPPA facilitate the provision of the plant list to the homeowner?

How does Claus make his knowledge available within constraints (money, time), while also being attributed for this work?

How do existing resources (e.g., the EU Butterfly Hub) facilitate the provision of the plant list to the homeowner?

## Use Case 6.1 - Citizen or Gardener - using Task 5.2 and 5.3 landscape mitigation tool (Andrea)

2. The user finds out about the EuroAppa tool to desing a pollinator-friendly landscape via involvement in a Butterfly LL, the EU poll hub, mediatic campaign by an NGO, institutional information, advocacy by a lobby, word-of-mouth, …
3. The user opens the web application. They draw a large polygon that includes the region they want to take action in, they  select “conservation” as their goal of the tool. If they want to present the seed mix to farmers, they might also select farming and the crops of interests. The tool can also accept the request to deliver suggestion compatible to both farming and conservation goals.
4. The tool retrieves a list of plants suited to support the target pollinator species that might be present in their area. The user can further filter the plant species by soil conditions, sun exposure, water requirements, life cycle, and maximum height. If they want to go deeper, fun facts and main characteristics of suggested plants and potential pollinators to be attracted are shown in a nutshell.
5. Additional information on nesting habitats or plants for larvae of target pollinators are showed. A small description and tutorial on how to create those is available.
6. The User promotes the use of seed mix and plants to people and entities (the case for users such as: NGOs, plant sellers, landscape managers, garden designers). Or they plant directly on the ground (the case for users such as: park managers, local institutions).

# **Invitation to provide a use case for EuroAPPA**  
(email to invite a variety of stakeholders)

**Subject line: Butterfly project action: Invitation to provide a use case for EuroAPPA**

Dear …, 

EuroAPPA will be a platform providing access to EU-wide pollination data and resources, developed as part of the project Butterfly. EuroAPPA is not a database per se, but will instead provide access and data reviews of multiple resources, including databases, from a single location. EuroAPPA will not be limited to the outputs of Butterfly, but provide access to previously existing resources as well. 

We expect the capabilities of EuroAPPA to be:    

- search and download pairwise interactions of plants and pollinators, including location and time (as in [GloBI](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org))
- search for evidence of effective pollination by different pollinators to wild and crop plants
- produce interactive maps of pollination interactions in Europe
- generate data reviews across databases with pollination information (including things like how many interactions have been recorded, where, when, the species involved, the source publications,…)

**We are asking for your input in the form of example(s) on how you would use EuroAPPA in your work** (=a use case)**.** Preparing a use case should not take more than 10 minutes. 

These use cases from diverse stakeholders will help us develop the best way to provide access to resources in EuroAPPA and what the interface should look like. Use cases can come from any potential user, from the general public to expert pollination scientists. Please use this simple format to prepare your use case(s):
